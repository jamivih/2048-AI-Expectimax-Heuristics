## 2048 AI Expectimax Heuristics

 with the number 2048. Here is a Python version that uses TKinter! 

This is a Python version of the popular 2048 game, created using Tkinter. Based on the game by Gabriele Cirulli (https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. This project demonstrates AI techniques, including heuristic algorithms and the expectimax algorithm, to play the game automatically. The AI combines various heuristics and simulations to optimize gameplay and achieve the best results.
